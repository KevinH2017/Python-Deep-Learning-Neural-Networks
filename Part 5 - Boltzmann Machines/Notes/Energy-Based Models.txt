Energy-Based Models (EBM)

EMBs are used to provide a unified framework for many probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches to learning, such as training
graphical and other structured models like generative artificial intelligence. EBMs are a class of generative models, which aim to
learn explicit probability distributions of data in the form of energy-based models, the energy functions of which are parameterized
by modern deep neural networks.

EMB Properties:
    - Simplicity and stability
    - Adaptive computation time
    - flexibility
    - Adaptive generation
    - Compositionality

The model will attempt to reach the lowest possible energy state.

Apps that use this model include natural language processing and computer vision.
