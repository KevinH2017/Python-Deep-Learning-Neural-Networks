Boltzmann Machine

Boltzmann Machine is a type of unsupervised network that is mainly used for recommendation systems.
There is a combination of hidden and visible nodes that have bidirectional connections with each other, and has no output layer.

Visible nodes can be measured and are measure.
Hidden nodes cannot be measured or are not measured.

It learns by taking in good examples and can model what a system's state is considered normal, then it is able to know when a system
is in an abnormal state. An example is a model to know when a nuclear reactor is in a normal state and when it is in an abnormal and dangerous state.
