Deep Belief Networks (DBN)

DBNs are sophisticated neural networks that are made up of several stacked RBMs, where the stacked Hidden Nodes flow 
down to the Visible Nodes. Each layer is capable of making sense of the information received from the previous layer, 
gradually bulding up a complex understanding of the overall data.

DBNs aim to extract different features from the input data, with the lower layers identifying basic patterns and higher
layers recognizing more abstract concepts. This allows the DBN is effectively learn complex datasets for tasks such as
image and speech recognition.

Deep Boltzmann Machines are not the same as Deep Belief networks.
