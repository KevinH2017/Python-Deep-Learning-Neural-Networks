Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)

RBM is a type of neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.
Fine-tuning the network is done with gradient descent and backpropagation.
RBM is a variant of Boltzmann Machines with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph.

A bipartite is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjount and independent sets.
    - A pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units ("visible" and "hidden" units) may have a symmetric
    connection between them
    - There are no connections between nodes within the group
