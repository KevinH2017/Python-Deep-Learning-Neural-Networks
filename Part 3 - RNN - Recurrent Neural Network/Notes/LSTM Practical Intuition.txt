Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Practical Intuition

LSTM is a neural network that allows information to persist.
By incorporating feedback connections, allowing it to process entire sequences of data, not just individual points.
LSTM can then learn patterns in text and speech, and improve itself over time.

Like learning how to get a website from a bunch of text by looking for patterns of www. and .com
When a quote starts and ends.
When a portion of code is part of a for-loop and what part of a line is the if-condition.
