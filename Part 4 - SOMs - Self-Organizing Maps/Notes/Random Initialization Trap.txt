Random Initialization Trap

Random initialization trap is a problem that occurs in the K-means algorithm. This occurs when the centroids of the
clusters to be generated are explicitly defined by the user, causing inconsistency that can lead to to generating
wrong clusters in the dataset, preventing the network from creating the correct clusters.

The right number of clusters depends on the size of the dataset.
Use the Elbow Method by plotting the sum of squares against increasing k values to find the point where the imporvement
slows down, the elbow.
The best number of clusters is the tip of the elbow, when improvement slows dramatically.

Note:
    Before the elbow: 
        WCSS drops quickly --> clusters become much better.
        
    After the elbow: 
        WCSS drops slowly --> extra clusters add little value and may lead to overfitting.
