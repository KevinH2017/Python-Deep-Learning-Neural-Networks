How Do SOMs Learn?

Self-Organizing Maps learn by finding different parts of the network to respond similarly based on certain input patterns.
Each node is calculated with its weights to determine which is the closest to desired value (0), called the "Best Matching Unit" (BMU)
for a given row of the network.
The nodes in a radius around the BMU have their weights adjusted to get closer to the BMU, the closer the node, the stronger it is pulled
to the BMU
The next row goes through the same process, the separate BMUs wll have their nearby nodes be pulled based on how close they are to them.
This separates the individuals nodes into clusters around the BMUs.

Over each iteration, the map will slowly adjust its BMUs into smaller and smaller organized networks so every node is assigned to a nearby BMU.
This is considered the "competition" where BMUs will fight for control over nodes

Note:
    - SOMs retain topology of the input set
    - SOMs reveal correlations that are not easily identified
    - SOMs classify data without supervision
    - No target vector, no backpropagation
    - No lateral connections between output nodes
