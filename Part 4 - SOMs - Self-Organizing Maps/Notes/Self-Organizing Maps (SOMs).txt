Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)

Self-Organizing Maps take in input layers with their weights to create a 2D output of neurons in a lattice shape.
Mainly used for feature detection.
This reduces the number of columns in ANN, CNN, and RNN types of neural networks.

It automatically places output neurons together that share properties in the training datasets, this is done without being
told how the datasets can be grouped together.
This is called "unsupervised learning algorithm".

The style of how the network is trained is "competitive learning", in which nodes compete for the right to respond to a subset
of input data.

The basic principles of competitive learning:
    - A set of neurons that are all the same except for some randomly distributed synpatic weights, and which therefore respond
    differently to a given set of input patterns.

    - A limit is imposed on the weights of each neurons.
    
    - An algorithm that the neruson use to compete for the right to respond to a given subset of inputs, such that only one output
    neuron (or only one neuron per group) is active ("on") at a time. The neuron that wins is called a "winner-take-all" neuron.
