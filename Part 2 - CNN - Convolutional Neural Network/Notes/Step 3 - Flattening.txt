Flattening

This step takes the pooled feature map and flattens it into a column.
After this step, you end up with a long vector of input data that you then pass through the neural network
for further processing.

So far, each of the steps are designed to extract and condense the important features from the input image.

Step 1: Input Image (Starting Point)
Step 2: Convolution Layer (Convolution Operation)
Step 3: Pooling Layer (Pooling)
Step 4: Input layer for the artificial neural network (Flattening)
