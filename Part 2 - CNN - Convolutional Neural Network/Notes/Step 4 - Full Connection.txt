Flattening --> [Input Layer, Fully Connected Layer, Output Layer] --> Output Value

The Fully Connected Layer (also known as the Dense Layer) is a layer in a neural network where each neuron is connected 
to every neuron in the previous layer. This layer is typically used at the end of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
to combine the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers and make predictions based on those features.

Each error that is made in the output value is then backpropagated through the network to update the weights
and biases of the neurons in the fully connected layer, as well as the filters in the convolutional and pooling layers.
Which improves the accuracy of the model over time.

This loop of forward propagation (making predictions) and backpropagation (updating weights and biases) can continue for
many iterations until the model reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy.
