Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is another version of ANN, it is primarily designed to extract features from
grid-like matrix datasets, or a 2D array of data arranged in rows and columns with indices.

This is useful for visual datasets such as images or videos, where data patterns play a crucial role.

CNNs are widely used for computer vision apps, due to their effectiveness in processing visual data.
CNNs consist of multiple layers, including the input layer, Convolutional layer, max pooling layer, 
flattening layer, fully connected layer, and output layer
EX:
    Input Layer --> Convolutional Layer --> Max Pooling Layer --> Flattening --> Fully Connected Layer --> Output Layer

Advantages of CNNs:

    - Good at detecting patterns and features in images, videos, and audio signals.
    - Robust to translation, rotation, and scaling invariance.
    - End-to-end training, no need for manual feature extraction.
    - Can handle large amounts of data and achieve high accuracy.

Disadvantages of CNNs:

    - Computationally expensive to train and require a lot of memory.
    - Can be prone to overfitting if not enough data or proper regularization is used.
    - Requires large amounts of labeled data.
    - Interpretability is limited, it's hard to understand what the network has learned.
