Max Pooling

Max Pooling selects the maximum element from the region of the feature map covered by the filter, then the output
after the max-pooling layer would be a feature map containing the msot prominent features of the previous feature map.
Max pooling preserves the most important features (edges, textures, etc.) and provides better performance in most cases.
