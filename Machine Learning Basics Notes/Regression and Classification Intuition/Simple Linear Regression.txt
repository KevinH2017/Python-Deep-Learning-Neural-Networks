Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is a model with a single explanatory variable. In other words, it is two-dimensional sample points with
one independent variable and one dependent variable and tries to find a linear function that accurately predicts the dependent
variable values as a function of the independent variable.

The accuracy is measured by its squared residual (vertical distance between the point of the data set and the fitted line),
with the goal to make the sum of these squared deviations as small as possible. With the slope of the fitted line is equal
to the correlation between x and y corrected by the ratio of standard deviations of these variables.

To find the best fitting line, you find the distance from the observations to the trend line.

The goal is to minimize the sum by finding the difference between the targeted and predicted values, then squaring them.
    Formula:
        SUM(y0 - y1)^2 -> min

Summary:

The aim is to describe how one variable (dependent variable) changes in relation with reference to the independent variable.
Such as using available information to make predictions of future results with a trend line.

Example:
    A company wants to predict sales based on advertising costs. By using simple linear regregression, they are
    able to determine if an increase in advertising can lead to higher sales or not.

    Predicting how much a person's salary will increase over time with their experience with a trend line.

Formula:
    y = b0 + b1 * X1

        y is the Dependent Variable (DV)
        b0 is the Constant
        b1 is the Coefficient
        x1 is the Independent Variable (IV)
