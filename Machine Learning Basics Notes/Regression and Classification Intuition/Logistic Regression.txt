Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems.
Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability
that an input belongs to a specific class.

It is used for binary classification where the output can be one of two possible categories such as Yes / No,
True / False, or 0 / 1.
It uses sigmoid function to convert inputs into a probability value between 0 and 1.

Types of Logistc Regression:

Binomial Logistic Regression
    - This type is used when the dependent variable has only two possible categories.
    It is the most common form of logistic regression and is used for binary classification problems.
    Example:
        Yes / No, True / False, 0 / 1

Multinomial Logistic Regression
    - This is used when the dependent variable has three or more possible categories that are not ordered.
    It extends the binary logistic regression to handle multiple classes.
    Example:
        Animal categories like "cat", "dog", or "sheep"

Ordinal Logistic Regression
    - This type applies when the dependent variable has three or more categories with a natural order of ranking.
    It takes the order of the categories into account when modeling.
    Example:
        Ratings like "low", "medium" and "high"
