Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is the same as simple linear regression but with two or more independent variables.
This is used to help understand how multiple features collectively affect the outcomes.

Formula:
    y = b0 + b1 * X1 + b2 * X2 + ... +bn * Xn

    y is the Dependent Variable (DV)
    bn * Xn is the Independen Variable (IV)
