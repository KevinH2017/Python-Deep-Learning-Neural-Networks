Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a method to predict a categorical dependent variable form a number
of independent variables.
This uses the sigmoid function to map the predicted values.

Example:
    Predicting if a person will purchase health insurance (Yes/No) based on their age.
    0 = No, 1 = Yes
    X = age
    Y = Do they purchase health insurance? (0 or 1)
