Normalization vs Standardization

The Machine Learning Process

All machine learning processes require data-preprocessing in order to build an effective model.

Data Pre-Processing: 
    - Import the data 
    - Clean the data 
    - Split into training and test sets

Modelling:
    - Build the model
    - Train the model
    - Make predictions

Evaluation:
    - Calculate performance metrics
    - Make a verdict


Training & Test Set

Training sets are used to build the model and with that model, apply the test set to get a predicted value vs the actual value
and see how accurate it is.


Feature Scaling

Feature scaling only applies to columns.

Normalization is taking the minimum of the column and subtracting that minimum from every value inside the column and dividing the value by
the maximum minus the minimum value of the column.

Forumula:
    x = (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin)
    Resuting lin values between 0 and 1. [0;1]

Standardization is subtracting the minimum by the average of the column and dividing that by the standard deviation of the column.

Formula:
    x = (X - mean(X)) / std(X)
    Resulting in values with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1

These methods are helpful to make sure all columns are on the same scale, so that no column has more weight than another column.
