Maximum Likelihood

The maximum likelihood is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model.
It does this by measuring how well a particular set of parameters explains the observed data.
The higher the value of the likelihood function, the better those parameters explain the data.
It "scores" the different paraters so that it can pick the ones that best fit the data.
