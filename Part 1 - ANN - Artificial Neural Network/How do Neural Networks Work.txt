How do Neural Networks Work?

Neural Networks work by using sets of standardized data is used as input values in the Input Layer, which is then passed to the 
Hidden Layer with weights that determine how much they affect the output value in the Output Layer

Input vales in the Input layer are given weights to be processed to the Output value in the Output layer    
    EX: w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3 + w4*x4 = Price
    - Weights multipled by input to get an output (Above does not include Hidden Layer)

Weights affect input values by making some more or less relevant in the Hidden Layer, adjusting how they affect the output value
With weight, some values can become entirely irrelevant to the output value
