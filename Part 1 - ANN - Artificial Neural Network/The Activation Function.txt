The Activation Function:

4 Types of Activation Functions:

1.) Threshold:
    - If the value is less than 0, then the threshold is 0
        EX: 0 if x < 0
    - If the value is greater than or equal to 0, then the threshold is 1
        EX: 1 if x >= 0

2.) Sigmoid:
    - A more gradual progression than Threshold function
        EX: (x) = 1 / 1 + e^-x
    - Very useful in the final learning steps and predicting the final answer

3.) Rectifier:
    - Starts at 0 and slowly increases to 1
        EX: (x) = max(x,0)
    - The most commonly used function for Artificial Intelligence apps

4.) Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh):
    - Similair to the Sigmoid function but can below 0 to -1
        EX: (x) 1 - e^-2x / 1 + e^-2x
