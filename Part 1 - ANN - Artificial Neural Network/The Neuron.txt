The Neuron:

A single neuron is made up of Dendrites, Neuron, and Axon
Synapses --> Receptor

In machines, Input Values / Independent Variables (Synapses) are passed to the Node (Neuron) 
and an Output Value is created (Axon)
    EX:
    IN --> Calculation --> OUT

Input Values must be Standardized, all of the same type or definition
Output Values can be Continuous (Price), Binary (Yes / No), or Categorical
The Input and Output values are considered a Single Observation and are also the same observation

Input Values are given Weights, which are how the neural network learns, it will adjust the weights to determine 
which is needs to be gradually changed to achieve the desired output

The Node takes in the Input Values and Weights into an Active Function (Learning Method) to get a desired Output Value,
if the output is desired it is then passed to the next Node for further calculations
