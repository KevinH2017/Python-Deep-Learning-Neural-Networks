Gradient Descent:

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm which is used to train neural networks and machine learning models 
by minimizing errors between predicted and actual results

Curse of Dimensionality:

The Curse of Dimensionality is the challenges and complications that can occur when analyzing and organizing data in
high-dimensional spaces (the features or variables in a dataset), this leads to large computational costs and impossible
amounts of data needed to make accurate predictions
