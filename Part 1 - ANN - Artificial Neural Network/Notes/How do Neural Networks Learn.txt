How do Neural Networks Learn?

Neural Networks learn by taking in input and comparing it to the expected output

If the output is incorrect, the network adjusts its internal parameters (weights and biases) to reduce the error

This occurs over many iterations, with the network gradually refining its parameters to minimize the difference between its 
predictions and the actual outcomes

This is called backpropagation, where the error is propagated back through the network to update the weights
