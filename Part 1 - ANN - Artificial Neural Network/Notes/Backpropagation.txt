Backpropagation:

Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting all the weights in the network
at once based on the error rate obtained in the previous iteration

This helps to minimize the error rate and improve the accuracy of the model

Forward Propagation is the initial phase where inputs are passed through the network to generate an output
